    <h1>Origin of Ramen</h1>

        <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>“RAMEN” is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese lamian (拉麺) meaning “hand-
            pulled noodles” the word derives from 撈麺(lamian, “lomein”) which is Cantonese 撈means
            to “stir” and the name refers to the method of preparation by stiring the noodles with a 
            sauce.</p>
    
        <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Until the 1950s, ramen was called shina soba (literally “Chinese soba”) but today chuka 
            soba (also meaning “Chinese soba”) or just Ramen are more common, as the word “支那” 
            has acquired a pejorative connotation.</p>

            <p>By 1990, restaurants serving Chinese cuisine from Canton and Shanghai offered a simple 
            ramen dish of noodles (cut rather than pulled), a few toppings, and pork bones.
            Many Chinese living in Japan also pulled portable food stalls, selling ramen and gyoza 
            dumplings to worker.</p>

            <p>By the middle 1900s, these stalls used a type of a musical horn called a charumera to 
            advertise their presence, a practice some vendors still retain via a loudspeaker and a 
            looped recording.</p>

            <p>By the eraly showa period, ramen has become a popular dish when eating out.
            After world war II, cheap flour imported from the US swept the Japanese market.
            At the same time, millions of Japanese troops had returned from China and continental 
            East Asia from their posts in the second Sino-Japan war.</p>

            <p>Many of these returnees has become familiar with Chinese cuisine and subsequently set 
            up Chinese restaurants across Japan. Eating ramen, while popular, was still a special 
            occasion that required going out.</p>

            <p>In 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, the Taiwanese-Japanese 
            founder and chairman of Nissin foods, now run by his son Koki Ando.
            Named the greatest in a Japanese poll, instant ramen allowed anyone to make this dish 
            simply adding boiling water.</p>

        <h2>Modern</h2>
            <p>Beginning in the 1980s, ramen became a Japanese cultural icon and was studieds around 
            the world from many perspectives. At the same time, local varieties of ramen were hitting 
            the national market and could even be ordered by their regional names.</p>

            <p>In meiji era it had become widely known and passed on from China town at some port such 
            as Kobe, Yokohama etc, when Japan had opened the country to the world.</p>
